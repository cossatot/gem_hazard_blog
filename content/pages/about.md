Title: About the GEM Hazard Team
Slug: about

The [GEM][GEM] Hazard Team is a small group of scientists focused on global and 
regional seismic hazard assessment. We develop openly-accessible earthquake 
hazard models at the regional level, typically in collaboration with national 
organizations and international projects. We also develop a [comprehensive, 
state-of-the-art suite of open-source earthquake hazard and risk modeling 
tools][openquake] that we and other organizations use to develop hazard models 
and related analysis at a range of scales.

One of our current major projects is the construction of a global mosaic of 
hazard models. This mosaic is built by synthesizing community-based or 
national/international projects where available, and creating new, openly 
accessible models in regions where current coverage is lacking.

### About the GEM Global Active Faults project

The [GEM](GEM) Global Active Faults project (GEM-GAF) is building a 
comprehensive, global dataset of active fault lines of seismogenic concern. The 
database will first and foremost be used for global, regional, and local 
seismic hazard, though it will certainly be useful for geoscientific research, 
education, and curiosity satisfaction as well.
