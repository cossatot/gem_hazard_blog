Title: About the GEM Hazard Team
Slug: about

GEM hazard team develops a comprehensive suite of tools for building earthquake 
hazard model and for computing seismic hazard. We also collaborate with several 
national organisations and international projects at the development of new and 
openly accessible earthquake hazard models. One of our current major goals is 
the construction of a mosaic of hazard models that by the end of 2018 will have 
global coverage. This mosaic is built relying a much as possible on models 
created either through community-based project or by renown national agencies 
and international projects.


### About the GEM Global Active Faults project

The [GEM](GEM) Global Active Faults project (GEM-GAF) is building a 
comprehensive, global dataset of active fault lines of seismogenic concern. The 
database will first and foremost be used for global, regional, and local 
seismic hazard, though it will certainly be useful for geoscientific research, 
education, and curiosity satisfaction as well.
