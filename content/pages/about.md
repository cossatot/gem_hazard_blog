### About the GEM Global Active Faults project

The [GEM](GEM) Global Active Faults project (GEM-GAF) is building a 
comprehensive, global dataset of active fault lines of seismogenic concern. The 
database will first and foremost be used for global, regional, and local 
seismic hazard, though it will certainly be useful for geoscientific research, 
education, and curiosity satisfaction as well.
